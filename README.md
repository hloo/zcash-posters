# zcash-posters
These Zcash posters are styled after vintage travel and propaganda posters. They are the result of an ongoing collaboration between Howard Loo, and member of the Zcash community and founder of the [Ycash Foundation](https://www.ycash.xyz), and Steve Thomas, an amazing artist whose work can be found at https://www.stevethomasart.com/. This project was funded by a grant from the Zcash Foundation, and the use of the Zcash trademarks within these posters is licensed by the Electric Coin Company.

We encourage you to share these posters with others! Steve Thomas also provides affordable prints of these posters at
