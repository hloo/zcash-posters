## About the Artist: Steve Thomas

Steve Thomas has created artwork under licenses from LucasFilm, Disney, Fox, Star Trek, Hasbro, and Marvel. Before becoming a freelance illustrator/graphic artist, Steve worked for newspapers creating graphics and illustrations for 14 years.

Steve draws inspiration from a number of sources, including vintage posters, early 20th century propaganda art, early 20th century product art, and mid 20th century retro-futuristic art.

No matter what the subject matter, from [Blink-82 concerts](https://www.stevethomasart.com/concert-posters) to [Star Wars](https://www.stevethomasart.com/large-grid-c23zf) to the [Minnesota Vikings Hall of Fame](https://www.stevethomasart.com/mnvikings), Steve's poster art is imbued with creativity, beauty, and (often) humor.
